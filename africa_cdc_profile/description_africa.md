## SARS-CoV-2 analyses for African countries

These analyses represent country- and region-level phylogenies for African countries.
The phylogenetic context sources from Nextstrain's Africa-focused regional builds, data for which are available through GISAID's "nextregions" downloads.
The rest of the phylogeny uses up to 6,000 sequences per country.
